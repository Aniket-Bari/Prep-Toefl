                        For this task, you will listen as someone speaks to you. You will repeat what you have heard after you hear the beep. The person will then speak again.

                        In the actual test, the clock will show you how much time you have to speak. Repeat the words aloud <b>one time only</b>

                        In this practice test, you will only listen to sample responses and read comments about them.

                        The Listen and Repeat practice items include examples of sentences being successfully repeated by test takers from a variety of language backgrounds. These examples of successful performances share these characteristics:
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        • They accurately repeat the meaning of the original sentence, with no more than one or two minor changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        • The pronunciation is easily intelligible and all or nearly all of the words are clear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        • Minor pauses or hesitation may be present, but do not impact intelligibility.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Test takers are not evaluated on intonation and stress, as long as there is no change to word-level meanings. Please note that to receive the maximum score, the response must be an exact repetition of the original sentence, where every word is clear and no words have been added, dropped, or changed.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>Select <b>Continue</b> to go on. </p>
